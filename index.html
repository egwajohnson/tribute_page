                    <dd>Thanks for reinventing the wheel. And thanks for all the breakthroughs that went unnoticed by the mass public that helped the less-massive public. Every person that owns even 1 Apple device has been touched by your genius and ideals, and I'm sure it's made their life that much better for it. I know it's made my life better. I'm glad you're not suffering anymore, and I hope your family and other loved ones will not be sad for long. Just wait patiently; in time, so many of your fans will see you again, when their time is up here. I wonder what you'll have in store for us on the other side. So long, and thanks for all the apples!.</dd>

                    <dt>A visionary cut down in his prime-sometimes the great die young... </dt>
                    <dd>I have a sadness in the pit of my stomach. I never knew Steve and have not used many of his products although I appreciate their style and ease of use. No-the world has lost a visionary and that is very sad. 56 is too young for any man to die but this becomes a tragedy when that man contributed so much to society. We will miss his infectious will to create not only superior products but a superior experience. His vision remains-hopefully it will inspire and new generation of inspired thinkers ready to reshape their our world..</dd>
